Q1.
The "case_long_iso_time_style:" was removed since it was a goto label
for the for loop in the second part of the edit. Since the goto for that
label has been removed in the other part of the patch, the label itself is
essentially useless without its respective goto.

Q2.
The edit will cause the date format to be displayed with string abbreviations,
however, there can be locations where abbreviations for the months either
do not exist or are different than that of english use. Thus this may cause
confusion for users in different locales

Q3.
Invoking the script on an empty file causes an index out of range error.
The script tries to choose a random line and read it out. It does this
with the random. choice() function, which
raises and IndexError if the sequience its
suppose to choose from is empty. It does this since it tries to look at an
object in a list, however since this list has length 0, and object index
will be larger than the list size and give an index error.

Q4.
Running randline.py returns a syntax error. This is because in python3,
tuple unpacking has been deprecated. The IOError originally in 
python 2 returned an exception tuple and could have been automatically
 unpacked as a tuple into the errno and strerror is
now no longer able to do so. Thus the syntax is incorrect
