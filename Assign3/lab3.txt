Patching LS
First we get the core utils files with
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

then we unzip the file with:
tar xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz 

we now make a new directory coreutilsInstall for the actual install
mkdir coreutilsInstall

we then configure, compile and install with the following commands
./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/hansenq/coreutilsInstall
make
make install

the prefix for configure will make it so that coreutils will be installed
in our specified directory
from here we can test that the ls function doesn't work properly with
/bin/ls -l

which gives us
-rw-r--r--  1 hansenq csugrad       46 2015-10-18 02:38 test1.txt


to patch this, we create a patchfile
in the original coreutils-7.6 directory
and copy the diff text into it
the we commane
patch -p1 <patchfile

this will use the diff text we put into
patch file and modify the files based on the given patch

the -p1 option is to specify that the base directory is included in the diff

after this is done, we just do
make

make install is not needed since make already recompiles the patched file 
into the already created directory. configure is not needed since a makefile
 has already been created and dependencies checked. Only the make command 
 is need to recompile the modified ls program based on the diff.

with the new ls, we can see that the patch has fixed the issue
on a recent file:
-rw-r--r--  1 hansenq csugrad       46 Oct 18 02:38 test1.txt


and on an older file
-rw-r--r--  1 hansenq csugrad        0 Jan 21  2014 somefile.txt


the last file was marked with touch -t 201401210959.30 somefile.txt
