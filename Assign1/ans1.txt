1. man -K "word" or man -k "word" the first one will query 
each file it finds to see if it should be opened,
 the second command simply lists all of the names that match the search
2. whereis cp, whereis wc
these functions return the location of the programs which are:
/bin/cp
and
/usr/bin/wc
3.find /usr/bin -type f -executable -name ?
this gives us the names with only one character, these are w, [, and X.
w shows what all users are doing at the moment. [ is the start of a conditional
 expression evaluation,
 just like TEST, except it needs a closing]. X runs a window system
4.ls /usr/bin -l
this lists out the directory that cc is in, from here, it can be seen that cc ->
 gcc, so gcc is actually being executed from /usr/bin/gcc
5. man chmod
g-s means that the users in the file's group will have the set group ID 
removed/cleared
6.find -mtime n allows for searching for 
files that have been modified within n days.
 7.find / -type d -mtime 3
this returns a large number of files
8. whereis find
this returns that find is in /bin and /usr/bin, thus we do
find /usr/bin -type l -ls | wc -l
find /bin -type l -ls | wc -l
to get the count of how many symbolic links there are in the two directories,
 they total out to be 346 + 18 = 364
9. find /usr/lib -type f -printf '%T+ %p \n' | sort
this prints out all the files' 
modification time and file name and then sorts that
 based on the time, since its the first thing in the line. 
 This shows that the oldest file based on modification time is
2003-08-29+12:56:11.0000000000 
/usr/lib/x86_64-redhat-linux5E/include/bits/stdio-lock.h
10.man locale
locale gets its data from global environment variables (i.e. LC_*)
11.C-h a s o r t Enter
this lists the commands with sort:
Buffer-menu-sort, sort-columns, sort-fields, sort-lines, sort-numeric-fields, 
sort-pages, sort-paragraphs, sort-regexp-fields, 
tabulated-list-col-sort, tablulated-list-sort
12. C-h b
this lists the function of all keybindings, from this we see that:
C-a		move-beginning-of-line
C-b		backward-char
C-c		mode-specific-command-prefix
C-d		delete-char
C-e		move-end-of-line
C-f		forward-char
C-g		keyboard-quit
C-h		help-command
TAB		indent-for-tab-command
C-j		electric-newline-and-maybe-indent
C-k		kill-line
C-l		recenter-top-bottom
RET		newline
C-n		next-line
C-o		open-line
C-p		previous-line
C-q		quoted-insert
C-r		isearch-backward
C-s		isearch-forward
C-t		transpose-chars
C-u		universal-argument
C-v		scroll-up-command
C-w		kill-region
C-x		Control-X-prefix
C-y		yank
C-z		suspend-frame
13. C-g is a quit function. It will quit lisp code that is running.
this was found by C-h f keyboard-quit
14. yank, bound to C-y, pastes the most recently killed/copied text
also found with C-h f yank
15. it appears that dired will list . files while ls -l does not 
(e.g. dired lists .fipscheck.hmac while ls -l does not). 
Thus dired will have a longer list
this was found by using diff to compare the outputs
of the two functions
